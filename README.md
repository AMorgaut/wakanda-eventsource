#WakandaDB Server-Sent Events#

##About##
 
This package is meant to provide an HTTP Push support to [WakandaDB](http://wakandadb.org) / [Wakanda](http://wakanda.org) via the W3C / WHATWG HTML5 Standard called **Server-Sent Events** aka **Event Source**.

This push technology [can be used on all modern platforms](http://caniuse.com/#search=eventsource) natively or via the [EventSource Polyfill](https://github.com/Yaffle/EventSource) for IE 
##How to use##

###Start the service###

Start the service on Wakanda Server. A good place for this code is usually a Wakanda bootstrap file.

```javascript
require('wakanda-eventsource').start();
```

The default listened pattern is "/eventsource". 

###Push Messages / Events###

Default `ServerEvent` are received by the client as `MessageEvent`. To send a `MessageEvent`to all client listeners you can simply write:

```javascript
require('wakanda-eventsource').push('a message from the server');
```

If you want to dispatch on the client a specific Server Event you can use `pushEvent()`

```javascript
require('wakanda-eventsource').pushEvent(
    'itempurchased', 
    '5 "DVD" items have been purchased'
);
```

You can push an event to one or more specific session(s), user(s), or group(s)
Users and groups can be specified by ids, names, or directly User/Group instances

```javascript
var sse = require('wakanda-eventsource');
// Important: The client-side EventSource connection need to be redone on login/logout
sse.pushEventToSession(currentSession(), 'itempurchased', '5 "DVD" items have been purchased');
sse.pushEventToUser(currentUser(), 'itempurchased', '5 "DVD" items have been purchased');
sse.pushEventToGroup(['Marketing', 'Engineering'], 'itempurchased', '5 "DVD" items have been purchased');
```

If you want the pushed messaged to be an object message, you can tell the method to encode it in JSON (you could do it yourself but this will make your code lighter). This option works for both `push()`and `pushEvent()` methods.

```javascript
require('wakanda-eventsource').pushEvent(
    'itempurchased',
    {
    	nb: 5,
    	type: 'DVD'
    },
    true // encode in JSON
);
```

###Listen Server Messages / Events from the client###

You must first create an `EventSource` Listener

```javascript
var sse = new EventSource('/eventsource');
```

You can ask the server to only send you specific events

```javascript
// ask to receive only "itempurchased" and "ordercancelled" events
// adding onmessage listener or listener for any other events than the listed 
// ones will have no effect
var sse = new EventSource('/eventsource/itempurchased,ordercancelled');
```

You can then listen to basic Server Message Events via an `onmessage` handler

```javascript
sse.onmessage = function onservermessage(event) {
	console.log(event)
};
```

Or you can listen to any specific events using `addEventListener()`

```javascript
sse.addEventListener('itempurchased', function onitempurchased(event) {
	var
		data;

	data = JSON.parse(event.data);
	console.log(data.nb, '"' + data.type + '"', 'items have been purchased')
});
```

##Potential Enhancements##

* this implementation should support **CORS** to allow potential event subscriptions for external web applications
* This implementation use **last event ID string** for reconnections but needs more tests
* an experimental `pause(delay)` method invite clients to reconnect later (we may allow to pause all connections not belonging to important groups)
* A parallel client-side lib could help binding such server-sent events to wakanda datasources for live update features
* this module should register itself as a Wakanda service and take benefits of service settings

##Disclaimer##

This package is not a native Wakanda component and 4D gives no guaranty to its usage
